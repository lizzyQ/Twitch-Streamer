## Synopsis

Twitch Streamer is a page of list of assorted Twitch user.

The listed information of a streamer includes avatar, streamer name, current streaming status. If it’s streaming, the streaming title will be seen, and if it’s a closed account, the notification will be seen. 

By click on a bar, it will take the user directly to the streamer’s Twitch.tv channel.

## Behind seen

I struggled when using jQuery $each with $ajax. I thought I should call ajax once then manipulate data after. But in this case, I ended up call ajax 24 times to access different page of the API.
